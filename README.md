# Specification
The aim of this coursework is to construct a simple simulation of the energy consumption- and energy
generation- of a smart house. In the house are a number of appliances which consume/generate electricity
or consume water when they operate, meters that record the amount of water and electricity
consumed/generated and a battery which stores excess electricity if the house happens to generate more
than it needs.
